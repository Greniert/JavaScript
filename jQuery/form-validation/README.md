# jQuery validation form

Starting from the page "form.html", develop the form validation with jQuery.
Put your code in js/scripts.js (you will use the included function validateEmail() to validate the e-mail fields).

### You must not modify the HTML and CSS files.

The fieldset "Your colleague subscription" is hidden by default. By clicking on the checkbox "Subscribe another company member", it appears and the fields inside must also be treated by your function.
